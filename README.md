This is the repository for the Home Assistant Configuration AI Agent add-on.

An AI-powered Home Assistant configuration assistant with approval workflow.

**Chat with your configuration:**
- "Enable debug logging for the MQTT integration"
- "Show me all my automations that involve lights"
- "Rename my 'Office Button' device to 'Desk Button'"
- "Create an automation that turns on the porch light at sunset"

1. **Install:** 
   - Search for "AI Configuration Agent"
   - Click Download
   - Restart Home Assistant

2. **Configure:**
   - Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration

The default model is `gpt-6-luna`, using OpenAI's `/responses` endpoint.
Keep the API base URL as `https://api.openai.com/v1` (do not append `/responses`).
Existing model/provider settings are preserved; select `gpt-6-luna` explicitly to
switch an existing installation, using an API key with access to that model.
Other model IDs continue to use `/chat/completions`.
